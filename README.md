## Cryptographic Algorithms in C#

This project provides a collection of implementations for various cryptographic algorithms in C#. It includes both classical ciphers like Caesar cipher and monoalphabetic substitution, as well as more advanced techniques like Diffie-Hellman key exchange and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman).
## Features

- Implementations of a variety of cryptographic algorithms
- Support for both classical and modern techniques
- Clear and well-documented code

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository: Use the following command to clone the repository from GitHub: <br />
``` git clone https://github.com/KholoudAhmedx/CyberSecurityProject.git ```
2. Build the Project: The project uses a standard .NET solution structure. You can build the project using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.

## Usage

The specific usage of each cryptographic technique will vary depending on the chosen algorithm. However, the provided implementations generally follow a common pattern: <br />

Classes: Each algorithm is implemented in a separate class. <br />
Methods: The class provides methods for encryption, decryption, and (where applicable) key generation.

## Testing

The SecurityPackageTest folder contains unit tests for each implemented algorithm. These tests can be used to verify the correctness of your code.

## Additional Notes

Consider including references or resources used for implementing these algorithms. <br />
You can mention future plans or potential contributions (if any). <br />
